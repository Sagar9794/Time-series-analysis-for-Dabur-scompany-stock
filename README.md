# Time-series-analysis-for-Dabur-scompany-stock
In this I have tried to fit a time series model i.e ARIMA model on Dabur company stock closing stock values and analyse if the model can predict 
correctly.

## The steps I have followed are 
1. Check if there is any trend in the series.
2. Check if the series is stationary or not using Dickey fuller test
3. If not stationary then stationarise the series
4. Split the series into train and test
5. Train the data using ARIMA model and predict the test data.
6. Calculate MSE,MAE,RMSE,MAPE
